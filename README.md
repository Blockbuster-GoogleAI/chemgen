# 🧪 AI-Powered Drug Discovery Assistant

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Simplify the drug discovery process using AI to:
- Predict chemical reactions between molecules.
- Identify the most suitable patient for drug testing.

## 💡 Our Solution
An AI-powered web platform offering:
1. **Generative AI Chemical Reaction Prediction**  
   Predicts reactions and checks stoichiometry, even when it's incorrect.

2. **Patient Clustering**  
   Uses clustering to find the most representative patient for testing.

## 🔍 What Makes It Unique?
